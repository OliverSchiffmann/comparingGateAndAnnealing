# comparingGateAndAnnealing
Repository to store code contributing to the publication "Comparing Gate and Annealing-based Quantum Computing for Configuration-Based Design Tasks".
Scipts for both the annealing approach and the grover's approach are stored along with the respective requirements.txt files.
The brute force approach used for comparison in the paper is also stored, along with the script used for results plotting.
